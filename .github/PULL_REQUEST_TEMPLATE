## How to Check and Fix Linting Issues

Run `npm run validate`. This command will run prettier and eslint checks to ensure linting guidelines are respected.

- If the command exits with code 0 (build is successful), there are no linting issues.

- If the command exits with a code other than 0, scroll up the command output and look for identified linting issues. Fix them and revalidate to check if the issues have been resolved by re-running the command.
