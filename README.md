## Project Description

The SpaceYaTech website is being redesigned to enhance its user experience and visual appeal.

The new website will be built using the following tech stack:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **GitHub**: platform for version control and collaboration.
- **Figma**: web-based vector graphics editor and prototyping tool.

Figma Design Reference: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/QZwtseXogSFjLNz64uLwjV/SYT-Website-Redesign-Complete?type=design&node-id=1113%3A7655&t=xSmmgQWxa0Z31bfo-1)

## Project Set Up

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/SYT-Web-Redesign.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**

   Change your current directory to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd SYT-Web-Redesign
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   Now you can start the development server and begin developing:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The project should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is already in use).
